        <h1>Volleyball</h1>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>“Volleyball” began as a letter-writing initiative in light of the Quebec National Assembly’s decision to
                not designate an official national day of truth and reconciliation to commemorate the violent legacy of
                residential schools in Canada. Out of a desire to make concrete the words contained in the letter, I
                sought to create something permanent that would encapsulate the spirit of the action. What resulted was
                a series of glazed porcelain geological remnants that each contain a little message on a rolled up piece
                of paper. The next stage will involve a more fleshed out community led activist project, accompanied
                with a large public installation of the sculptures. </p>
